## ✍️ Part 1: Essay Questions

### Q1. Edge AI: Latency & Privacy

- **Focus**: Compare Edge AI and cloud-based AI in terms of latency and privacy.
- **Key Points**:
  - Edge AI enables local processing on devices like drones or Raspberry Pi.
  - Reduces latency by avoiding cloud roundtrips.
  - Enhances privacy since data isn't transmitted to centralized servers.
- **Example**: Autonomous drones analyzing aerial images in real-time without transmitting footage externally.

### Q2. Quantum AI vs Classical AI

- **Focus**: Differences in optimization capabilities.
- **Key Points**:
  - Quantum AI leverages superposition and entanglement for faster convergence.
  - Classical AI relies on brute-force heuristics and gradient descent.
- **Industries Benefiting Most**:
  - Logistics (e.g., route optimization)
  - Pharma (e.g., molecular simulations)
  - Finance (e.g., portfolio optimization)

### Q3. Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare

- **Focus**: Social and professional impacts.
- **Key Points**:
  - Augments decision-making for radiologists with high-accuracy diagnostics.
  - Assists nurses in monitoring patient vitals using predictive analytics.

## 🚀 Part 3: Futuristic AI Proposal (2030)

### Title: AI-Powered NeuroTherapist – Brain-Computer Interface Mental Health System (BCI-MH)

#### 1. Problem It Solves
By 2030, mental health disorders—such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD—are expected to surpass cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of disability worldwide. Barriers to therapy include cost, stigma, limited access to professionals, and difficulty in verbalizing emotions or adhering to treatment plans.

#### 2. Proposed AI Solution
An AI-powered NeuroTherapist system integrated with non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices (e.g., next-gen EEG headbands) provides continuous monitoring of emotional and cognitive states. It delivers personalized feedback and interventions in real time to support mental health.

#### 3. AI Workflow

- **Data Inputs**:
  - Brainwave patterns from EEG/BCI sensors
  - Facial microexpressions via integrated camera
  - Speech tone and content from recorded conversations
  - Behavioral metrics such as sleep, physical activity, and daily routines

- **Model Types**:
  - **Multimodal Deep Learning**: Fuses multiple sensory streams (EEG + vision + audio)
  - **Transformer Models**: Tracks and interprets emotional state changes over time
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Adapts therapy strategies based on user response and engagement

- **Outputs**:
  - Real-time emotional insight and stress level feedback
  - Personalized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) exercises
  - Alerts for neural crises such as suicidal ideation or panic attacks

#### 4. Societal Benefits
- Provides stigma-free, accessible mental health care—especially in underserved communities
- Reduces strain on healthcare systems by offering continuous, scalable mental health support
- Enables early detection and intervention before conditions escalate
- Adapts treatment to individual neural patterns, enhancing therapeutic efficacy

#### 5. Potential Risks
- **Privacy Concerns**: Risk of data breaches or unauthorized use of sensitive neural data
- **Overdependence**: Users may become reliant on AI, reducing human therapist interaction
- **Bias & Misdiagnosis**: Potential for misinterpretation of diverse brain patterns due to limited training data



## ✨ Bonus Task (10%)

### Quantum Simulation: IBM Quantum Experience

- **Activity**: Code a quantum circuit for superposition and entanglement.
- **Optimization Target**:
  - Use quantum search (e.g., Grover's algorithm) for AI-driven drug discovery.
  - Benefit: Reduces search complexity for molecular structures.
