## üìç Project Goals

- Train a compact CNN model to classify recyclable items (e.g., bottles).
- Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite for deployment.
- Simulate edge inference using Colab to test latency and performance.
- Highlight real-world benefits of Edge AI in low-power, privacy-sensitive scenarios.
