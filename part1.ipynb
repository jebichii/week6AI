    "\n",
    "### 🚦 How Integrating AI with IoT Enhances Urban Sustainability\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Smarter Traffic Flow and Emission Reduction**\n",
    "- AI algorithms analyze real-time data from IoT sensors (e.g., cameras, GPS, traffic lights) to optimize traffic signals.\n",
    "- This reduces vehicle idling time, congestion, and fuel consumption—directly cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
    "- Dynamic rerouting of vehicles based on live traffic conditions also minimizes unnecessary travel, improving fuel efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Predictive Maintenance and Infrastructure Longevity**\n",
    "- IoT sensors embedded in roads and bridges collect wear-and-tear data.\n",
    "- AI models detect anomalies and forecast maintenance needs, enabling preventive repairs.\n",
    "- This extends infrastructure life, reduces material waste, and conserves resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data-Driven Urban Planning**\n",
